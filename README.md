# DataProjects
my attempts at scripting code for data analysis, data exploration, data cleaning and other amateur stuff
There are two SQL projects here, one is a data exploration project and the other is a data cleaning project
The data exploration project was done using Covid data, data accessible through https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus
The data cleaning project used a housing data for nashville, file sourced from the internet (unknown) and uploaded in the repository
